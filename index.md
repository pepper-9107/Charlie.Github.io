I am feeling so sorry to settle down my blog and really struggle to make it smooth to browse the website. Maybe I should pay more effort to learn, but now, here is my review #001.

### 1 What does this section say?

From my point of view, this section of the story depicts an ideal and simplified world as a mirror of the real world by structing up the common rules and setting four basic characters, which implies the outside and the inside laws. To give some examples of the rules, every character is born to chase the nourishments and happiness – in other words, physical and spiritual strengths – and they will spare no effort to do so. The concept of the Maze is also fascinating, it is puzzle-like with numerous corridors and chambers, but up to now it rarely shows the cruelty of the jungle where we live. What makes the four different is the methods which depends on their own desires and thoughts in mind.

The story begins, based on the settings, with a turn of the behaviors of the mice and the human-beings shortly after both of them acknowledged where to get the cheese. On one hand, the mice followed the primitive path, repeating the routine every morning; On the other hand, the two owners of complex brain chose to change the rules, but they soon realized that there was something more complicated, with a capital C, awaited them to chase. In a word, the complicated allured them and made them sophisticated. Therefore, the human built a social life around the cheese station, hoping that to stay closer, more convenient, is beneficial.

Apart from what the section is mainly talking about, which I have quoted above, I am enchanted with a sentence and want to suggest my idea.

It said that “They had no idea where the Cheese (with the capital C) came from, or who put it there. They just assume it would be there.” I guess it indicates that behind the question about” WHAT” the Cheese is, there is a question about “WHY”, to express clearly, why they SHOULD race out to the Cheese. 

Because “Cheese makes you happy and successful”?

Before actions, we are supposed to reflect what we really want. Sometimes a pure and beautiful could be an illusion. On this condition, the pursuit cannot bring us what we want because we don’t actually find out the laws under the path.

The stories of regret never stop happening in the life. Only we reach something can we find it nothing. However, where is our some-thing? That is the core of having a life with full meanings and happiness, and totally speaking my story is a story telling a person to figure out her some-thing.
